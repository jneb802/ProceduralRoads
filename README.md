# ProceduralRoads

A Valheim mod that generates procedural roads connecting locations across your world.

## Features

- Automatically generates roads from spawn to nearby points of interest
- Terrain-aware pathfinding that follows natural contours
- Configurable road width, length, and count

## Installation

1. Install [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Install [Jotunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/)
3. Drop `ProceduralRoads.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`

## Configuration

Edit `warpalicious.ProceduralRoads.cfg` in `BepInEx/config/`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| RoadWidth | 4 | Road width in meters (2-10) |
| IslandRoadPercentage | 50 | Percentage of islands that will have roads (0-100). Largest islands selected first. |
| CustomLocations | (empty) | Comma-separated list of location names to include in road generation |

### Road approaches and protected locations

Roads approach the outside of locations while preserving their authored terrain and paint, including locations that are not road destinations. On hillsides, the generator searches for an arrival near the site's elevation and blends the final road profile into the ground. Excavated interiors do not pull an exterior approach down into the excavation.

`Roads / MaxGrade` defaults to `0.35` (35% rise over run). It constrains the planned route and height profile; `0` disables the grade cap. Climbing switchbacks use wider turns and gentler landing profiles. A route that cannot fit the grade, turn or location-clearance constraints can be refused, leaving the location without a road. Actual ground still depends on the game's terrain limits and existing edits.

These routing changes apply when generating a network. They do not remove terrain damage already baked by an older network. Test regeneration on a disposable world or copy first.

Diagnostics: `road_site <x> <z>` describes a nearby location; `road_ends` compares locations with nearby road points. Its height differences are diagnostic measurements, not proof that an entrance or turn is walkable. See [validation and follow-ups](docs/ROAD-FOLLOWUPS.md) and the [offline approach audit](docs/SITE-APPROACH-AUDIT.md).

### Custom Locations via Config

Use the `CustomLocations` setting to add locations from other mods (e.g., Expand World Data):

```
CustomLocations = Runestone_Boars,Runestone_Greydwarfs,MerchantCamp
```

## API for Mod Authors

Other mods can register locations for road generation programmatically.

### Direct Reference (if embedding or referencing the DLL)

```csharp
using ProceduralRoads;

// Register a location
RoadNetworkGenerator.RegisterLocation("MyCustomLocation");

// Unregister if needed
RoadNetworkGenerator.UnregisterLocation("MyCustomLocation");

// Get all registered locations
IReadOnlyCollection<string> locations = RoadNetworkGenerator.GetRegisteredLocations();
```

### Reflection (soft dependency, no DLL reference required)

```csharp
private static void RegisterRoadLocation(string locationName)
{
    var assembly = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
        .FirstOrDefault(a => a.GetName().Name == "ProceduralRoads");

    if (assembly == null) return;

    var generatorType = assembly.GetType("ProceduralRoads.RoadNetworkGenerator");
    var method = generatorType?.GetMethod("RegisterLocation", 
        System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Static);

    method?.Invoke(null, new object[] { locationName });
}
```

### Available API Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `RegisterLocation` | `void RegisterLocation(string locationName)` | Add a location to road generation |
| `UnregisterLocation` | `void UnregisterLocation(string locationName)` | Remove a location from road generation |
| `GetRegisteredLocations` | `IReadOnlyCollection<string> GetRegisteredLocations()` | Get all registered location names |

### Notes

- Register locations during mod initialization (Awake/Start)
- Location names must match the prefab name exactly (e.g., `Runestone_Boars`, not `Runestone Boars`)
- Both API registrations and config entries are merged at generation time
